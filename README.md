# ndvi_to_variable_N_application
Lecture notes - Education purpose.

The "ndvi_to_variable_nitrogen_application_map" plugin v. 0.1 was developed and tested in QGIS 3.22 version. While testing it in QGIS v. 3.34 (LTR) one option in the code was causing it to crash. The new version of the QGIS plugin v. 0.2 was modified and succesfully tested in QGIS 3.16, 3.22 and 3.34 versions.

Use of NDVI (or EVI) index for producing site-specific nitrogen application maps in agriculture. 

QGIS plugin "ndvi_and_evi_index_calculator" (Experimental plugin ready!) and plugin for recommending site-specific N application rates (currently under development) based on NDVI and EVI are for educational purposes.

By the end of this year I will publish a QGIS plugin which can be used to conduct entier process described in the slides (NDVI to variable N application.pdf) automatically.
