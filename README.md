# ndvi_to_variable_N_application
Lecture notes - Education purpose.

Use of NDVI (or EVI) index for producing site-specific nitrogen application maps in agriculture. 

QGIS plugin "ndvi_and_evi_index_calculator" (Experimental plugin ready!) and plugin for recommending site-specific N application rates (currently under development) based on NDVI and EVI are for educational purposes.

By the end of this year I will publish a QGIS plugin which can be used to conduct entier process described in the slides (NDVI to variable N application.pdf) automatically.
